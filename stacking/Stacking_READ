This folder contains stacking and pseudo-BMA code.

Some of the files might require slight changes, as they currently import and save data from addresses on my own device.

The main file is plancklite_tri_BMA.ipynb, which requires the FastMPCarviz and nfcov_arviz4_dense files. Additional libraries are required, but these should all 
be regularly installable.

The cosmological data is imported from the 'data' folder.
