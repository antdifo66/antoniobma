FastMPClinpara is heavily based on Simone Paradiso's FastMPC program (the link to which is in the readme), with some small changes.

polynomialbma contains the code to create polynomial data, fit it, and then run BMA analysis on it. The purpose of this is to easily be able to run this process mutliple times with different amounts of noise.
